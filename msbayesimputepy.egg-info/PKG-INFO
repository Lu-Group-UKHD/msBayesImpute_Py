# Mass Spectrometry Bayesian Imputation (msBayesImpute)

msBayesImpute is a versatile framework for handling missing values in Mass Spectrometry proteomic data based on Pyro (a probabilistic progamming language). 
msBayesImpute integrates probabilistic dropout models into Bayesian matrix factorization in a data-driven manner. 
Its advantage is taking into account the mixed patterns of missing at random (MAR) and missing not at random (MNAR).

## Main folder sturcture
```bash
msbayesimputepy 
|---data # one example data (HeLa cell line proteomics data)
|---msbayesimputepy # Python scripts, also name of msBayesImpute Python version
|---msbayesimputepy.egg-info # metadata about the Python package
|---dist # the compressed Python package
|---vignettes # examples of msBayesImpute execution in Python (quick_guide_python.ipynb)
â”‚   README.md 
|   requirements.txt # package dependencies msbayesimputepy needs
```

## Installation
Currently, as the Python package is confidential, only installation locally is feasible. The lab members 
can copy the folder from my labtop. Alternatively, I will push the whole folder to our lab's Github repository soon. 
You can download it there.

### Python package
```r
pip install dist/msbayesimputepy-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```
